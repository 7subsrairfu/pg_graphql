## How to Play ATC3
 
ATC3 is not a very difficult game to play, but it does require some basic knowledge of aviation and air traffic control. Here are some tips and tricks to help you get started:
 
- Before you start a stage, you can choose the difficulty level, the time of day, the weather conditions, and the number of flights. You can also customize the game settings, such as the voice volume, the radar range, the message speed, and the language.
- The game interface consists of several windows that show different information. The main window is the radar screen, where you can see the position, altitude, speed, and heading of the flights. You can also see the runways, taxiways, gates, and other airport facilities. You can zoom in and out of the radar screen by using the mouse wheel or the + and - keys.
- The other windows show the flight list, the message log, the command menu, and the clock. The flight list shows the details of each flight, such as the call sign, the origin, the destination, the aircraft type, and the status. You can select a flight by clicking on it or by typing its number on the keyboard. The message log shows the communication between you and the pilots. The command menu shows the available commands that you can give to a flight, such as clearance, altitude, heading, speed, frequency change, etc. The clock shows the current time and date.
- To give a command to a flight, you have to select it first and then choose a command from the menu or type it on the keyboard. For example, if you want to clear a flight for takeoff from runway 34L, you have to select it and then type C34L or click on Clearance > Takeoff > 34L. You can also use shortcuts for some commands, such as A for altitude, H for heading, S for speed, etc.
- You have to follow some rules and procedures when controlling the air traffic. For example, you have to maintain a safe separation between flights, avoid conflicts and collisions, assign appropriate runways and gates according to the wind direction and aircraft size, coordinate with other controllers when transferring flights to different sectors or frequencies, etc.
- You can pause or resume the game by pressing P or ESC. You can also save or load your progress by pressing F5 or F6. You can quit the game by pressing Q.

ATC3 is a realistic and immersive game that will test your multitasking and decision-making skills. It is also a great way to learn more about aviation and air traffic control. Have fun and good luck!
